# What is this?
I have created this repo to store things that I learn and my own implementations of them. I keep adding to it as I learn and start using more concepts or code snippets in contests and practice.

# Navigation
The directory names are a guide for most of what is contained in this repo. I also will add more language specific things like macros, algs implemented. Currently C++ is the main language.

# Note
There are many preprocessor directives since I use macros for competitive coding extensively. This is not good practice for normal coding and working on other people/organization's codebases.
