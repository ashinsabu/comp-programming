# What is this?
I have created this repo to store things that I learn and my own implementations of them. I keep adding to it as I learn and start using more ds,algs,concepts,math in contests and practice.

# Navigation
The directory names are a guide for most of what is contained in this repo. I also will add more language specific things like macros, algs implemented. Currently C++ is the main language being used and I'm hoping to implement the same things in Python as well with time as a side project just to learn Python and its syntax.

# Note
I frequently use the std/bitsc++ to include all required header files in standard C++ at once. This is not good practice but I use it as it saves me time. During normal development, it is better to use the individual header files as required to not cause much overhead for the compiler.
There are also many preprocessor directives since I use macros for competitive coding extensively. This is also not good practice for normal development and working on other people/organization's codebases.
